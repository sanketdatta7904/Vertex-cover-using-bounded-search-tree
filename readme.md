Implemented the matching-based 2-approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover as well as the simple
Bounded Search Tree method for exact Vertex Cover computation. Furthermore, implemented
some modification of the BST algorithm to improve its practical running time without hurting
its correctness.
Use the PACE 2019 graphs as benchmark data (https://pacechallenge.org/2019/vc/)

Running command:
    python exercise03/main.py
    Then give choice of 1/2/3/4/5 (Tested with 5 graphs, check report for the diagram of graph)


** Please comment from line 122 to line 135 in main.py for testing the 5th option. As brute force method takes huge amount of time to test big graph.
